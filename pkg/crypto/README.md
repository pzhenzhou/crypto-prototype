## What is the best way(s) to provide the seed ?

Seed phrases ( mnemonic) are now commonly applied to generate seeds. The main reasons for this are

1. it is easier for users to remember and manage than managing multiple private keys and binary passwords (like non-deterministic wallets for example)
   because the seed phrases is made up of a series of 12 to 24 digits, which is easier to remember and manage than random numeric passwords.
2. This is compatible with most major wallets as a standard, so when the current wallet is deleted or when you want to switch wallet applications, 
you can simply restore them by using the mnemonic.
